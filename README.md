# Microsoft-Rewards-Bot

Microsoft Rewards (Bing Rewards) Bot - Completes searches and quizzes, written in Python! :raised_hands:

## Overview

This program will automatically complete search requests and quizzes on Microsoft Rewards! Search terms are the daily top searches retrieved using Google Trends' API. This bot runs selenium in headless mode for deployment on VPS and for increased performance on local machines. The bot also uses selenium's user agent options to fulfill points for all three platforms (pc, edge browser, mobile). 100% free to use and open source. Code critique/feedback and contributions welcome!

## Development

The current master branch is pretty dated with to-do untouched. Since the developers' current commitment to the project is unknown, I have decided to take the current state and further develop it. 

The master branch will be used for stable release. For now, there is no stable release - I do not intend to call my locally tested alpha version stable. You are encouraged to try the alpha version out. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

- [v2.0.1 alpha](https://github.com/tmxkn1/Microsoft-Rewards-Bot/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
