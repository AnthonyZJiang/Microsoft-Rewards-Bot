# Microsoft-Rewards-Bot

Microsoft Rewards (Bing Rewards) Bot - Completes searches and quizzes, written in Python! :raised_hands:

## Overview

This program will automatically complete search requests and quizzes on Microsoft Rewards! Search terms are the daily top searches retrieved using Google Trends' API. This bot runs selenium in headless mode for deployment on VPS and for increased performance on local machines. The bot also uses selenium's user agent options to fulfill points for all three platforms (pc, edge browser, mobile). 100% free to use and open source. Code critique/feedback and contributions welcome!

## Development

The current master branch is dated and the previous developers' current commitment is unknown. Therefore, I have decided to take the current state of the project and further develop it. I have released an [alpha version](https://github.com/tmxkn1/Microsoft-Rewards-Bot/releases/tag/v2.0.1) and it runs well on my local machine. You are encouraged to try it out and any feedback is greatly appreciated.
